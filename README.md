# Hackathon Super Awesome template title changed by Dev WOW

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript starter template with Bootstrap for building websites quickly.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with Bootstrap and responsive layout
- `styles.css` - Custom CSS styles
- `script.js` - JavaScript for interactivity

## Comments

We've added comments to this template to help you understand the structure and functionality of the code.

These can be safely removed once you're comfortable with the setup.

## Getting Started

### Running the Project

Run a local server using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Any changes to the files will automatically reflect in the browser upon refresh.

#### Auto-Reload

To enable auto-reloading during development, you can use a tool like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VSCode.

When install, click the "Go Live" button at the bottom-right corner of VSCode to start the server with auto-reload functionality.

You will then be able to see changes in real-time as you edit your files.

Go to `http://localhost:5500` (or the port specified by Live Server) to view your project.
